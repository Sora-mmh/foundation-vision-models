# CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)

## Overview
CLIP is a neural network trained on a variety of image-text pairs to learn visual concepts from natural language supervision. It can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply providing the names of the visual categories to be recognized.

## Key Features
- **Multi-modal Learning**: Learns from image-text pairs
- **Zero-shot Capability**: Can classify images without task-specific training
- **Contrastive Learning**: Uses contrastive loss to align image and text representations
- **Scalable Training**: Trained on large-scale web-collected datasets

## Architecture
1. **Image Encoder**: Vision Transformer or ResNet for image feature extraction
2. **Text Encoder**: Transformer for text feature extraction
3. **Contrastive Learning**: Aligns image and text features in shared space
4. **Similarity Computation**: Measures cosine similarity between features

## Components
- **Vision Backbone**: ViT or ResNet for image encoding
- **Text Transformer**: BERT-like architecture for text encoding
- **Projection Layers**: Linear layers to project features to shared space
- **Contrastive Loss**: NT-Xent loss for alignment

## Theory
CLIP learns a multi-modal embedding space by training on image-text pairs. The model is trained to predict which images are paired with which texts in a batch, using a contrastive objective. This enables zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks by using natural language to reference visual concepts.

## Usage
```python
from model import CLIPModel, CLIPLoss

# Initialize model
clip = CLIPModel("ViT-B/32", pretrained="openai")

# Encode images and texts
image_features = clip.encode_image(images)
text_features = clip.encode_text(texts)

# Compute similarity
similarity = image_features @ text_features.t()

# Compute loss
loss_fn = CLIPLoss()
loss = loss_fn(image_features, text_features)
